# Bearmap
  Bearmap is a simplified map for Berkeley and it is capable of performing most features you would expect of a mapping 
application. 
  I implement the back end of this application, including map dragging/zooming, map rastering, autocomplete, and finding
shortest path between two locations by A* search algorithm.
